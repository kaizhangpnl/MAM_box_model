# The MAM aerosol microphysics box model

Atmospheric aerosol particles play a crucial role in the climate system, influencing cloud formation, radiation balance, and atmospheric chemistry. The representation of aerosol microphysics in global aerosol models involves numerous physical and numerical assumptions as well as approximations, leading to significant discrepancies in the simulated aerosol physical properties and lifecycles among different models. Simplified models that isolate aerosol microphysics from resolved atmospheric dynamics and other parameterized processes (e.g., clouds and radiation) enable researchers to pinpoint the root causes of these discrepancies, which can be obscured in full global model comparisons.

The ```Modal Aerosol Module``` (MAM, Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2016) in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) provides a simplified yet comprehensive treatment of aerosol processes. Supported by the ```Climate Model Development and Validation – Software Modernization``` (CMDV-SM) and ```E3SM Software Modernization``` projects, we have developed a new box model driver for the MAM aerosol microphysics calculations. This development also extends the functionality of the box model to facilitate comparisons of various aerosol microphysics treatments commonly used in global aerosol models, using either idealized or observation-constrained initial conditions and atmospheric states.

The MAM aerosol box model driver offers a convenient tool for new aerosol modelers to learn and test different aerosol microphysics parameterizations. It is also well-suited to support aerosol microphysics model intercomparison studies and machine learning applications (such as training data generation) aimed at enhancing global aerosol models.

## Description 

### Features  

- MAM aerosol code is the same as used in E3SMv1 (same module/data structure)
- Namelist control for meteorological state and initial condition of aerosol/gas concentrations 
- Single-box or multi-box model configuration using data structure applied in the atmosphere component of E3SM/CESM
- Either idealized aerosol/gas initial condition or data from an E3SM simulation
- Example data for selected ARM sites 
- Various drivers now available for testing individual processes in isolation or in combination
- Improved I/O (now netCDF) and post-processing workflow

## Documentation 

To be updated.  

## Test cases

We have developed offline drivers for aerosol microphysical processes including water uptake, nucleation, condensation, coagulation, aging, and redistribution of particles among modes of different size ranges. In addition to performing unit tests for individual aerosol processes, the box model is also used to test numerical convergence for time integration of multiple processes and the impact of operator splitting.
